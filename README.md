Simple now.js polygon editing by WCMC

## Bootstrapping
- Install npm ( https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installation )
- Install now to npm with `npm install now`

## Running
node server.js

## Problems?
"Cannot find module `now`"
Did you install node via brew? Bad idea, go install from source.

## Node modules needed
-ejs
-express
-now 
(install these with 'npm install <package-name>')
